					<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
					<p>
						HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is used to tell browsers how to
						render the information in websites that a user visits. For Example:
					</p>
					<code class="highlight">&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
					<p>
						The above example is raw code and not what a user should see. The
						user will see, when properly rendered, the following:
					</p>
					<code class="highlight"><h1>Hello World</h1></code>
					<p>
						In the above example the code was rendered correctly. Note how the
						font is larger and bolded. This comes from the tag itself telling
						the browser how to behave.

					<code class="highlight"
						>&lt;span&gt;I am an example of a typical
						&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; element&lt;/span&gt;</code
					>
					<p>These are the standard parts of an HTML element.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Opening Tag</strong> - The name of the element enclosed in
							angled brackets. This tells the browser where the element begins
							or where to start an affect, such as the &lt;strong&gt; element
							changing text to be bold.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Content</strong> - The meat and potatoes. This is the
							actual information that is presented to the user, such as the text
							you are reading right now. However, content is not limited to just
							text. It can be an image or video, or even a game.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Closing Tag</strong> - This is the tag at the end of the
							element. It tells the browser where the element stops or an affect
							end, such as only the word "HTML" in the above is bold. Without a
							closing tag, the browser will assume that all that follows that
							opening tag is part of that element. So watch out for that. Some
							tags are self-closing, meaning they don't need a closing tag.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Element</strong> - This is what the opening tag, content
							and closing tag are collectively known as.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						<strong>Nesting</strong> - The act of adding an element to another
						element, also used to refer to adding content. All of the element
						being nested must be inside the opening and closing tags of the
						parent element. Like so:
					</p>
					<code class="highlight"
						>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am an
						example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code
					>
					<p>
						In the above example, the span element was nested in the div
						element. In this case the span element is known as the child of the
						div element, which is the parent element.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Classes</strong> - A class is a name given to an element,
						usually used to style that element. A class can be given to multiple
						elements. For example:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="margin">
							<code class="highlight"
								>&lt;div class="example"&gt;I am example 1&lt;/div&gt;</code
							>
						</li>
						<li class="margin">
							<code class="highlight"
								>&lt;div class="example"&gt;I am example 2&lt;/div&gt;</code
							>
						</li>
						<li class="margin">
							<code class="highlight"
								>&lt;div class="example sample"&gt;I am example
								3&lt;/div&gt;</code
							>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Classes are denoted with a period at the front. In the above
						examples, all three elements have the class .example, and only one
						has the class .sample. So if .example is targeted for styling, all
						three would have that styling applied. However if .sample is
						targeted then only example 3 would be affected.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>ID's</strong> - An id, written as
						<code>id="example"</code> is similar to classes. However there are 2
						main differences. An ID must be unique to a single element, for
						example, if id="sample" is used for an element then it can't be used
						again. The second difference is that instead of a period to denote
						an ID, a pound sign(#) is used.

				<header>Block and Inline Elements</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						<strong>Block</strong> - Elements in this family are always started
						on a new line. They take up the full width available, such as the
						entire parent element in which they are located. Two of the most
						common block elements are the <code class="word">p</code> and the
						<code class="word">div</code>
						elements. As an example:
					</p>
					<div>I am a div!</div>
					<p>
						<strong>Inline</strong> - Inline elements are elements that do NOT
						start a new line. They also only take up as much width as necessary
						in order to hold their content. An inline element can be nested
						inside a block level element, however an inline element can not hold
						a block level element. As an example:
					</p>
					<code class="highlight"
						><p>
							I am before an inline element;
							<span class="inline">I am an inline element!</span> And I am after
							the inline element!
						</p></code
					>
					<p>
						Notice how the inline element, in this case a
						<code class="word">span</code>, is the only part of the element with
						a red background. The rest of the element is a
						<code class="word">p</code> element.

					<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
					<p>
						CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe how
						an HTML element is displayed. It can control multiple web pages at
						once. It removed the clutter of trying to style HTML from the
						inside. CSS controls many things in an HTML document, from font
						size, style and color, to adding animation to elements. The page you
						are reading right now was extensively styled with CSS.
					</p>
					<p><code class="word">p { color: green; }</code></p>
					<p>
						The above is a standard example of CSS styling. In this case the
						styling would change the font color to green in any
						<code class="word">p</code> element present on the page.
